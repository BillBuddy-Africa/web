                            <p>At BillBuddy, we are committed to preventing money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes. We fully comply with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) regulations in Nigeria and adhere to international best practices to ensure that our platform is not misused for illicit activities.</p>
                            <p>Money laundering involves concealing the origin, source, or destination of illicitly obtained funds. These funds may come from illegal activities such as extortion, insider trading, drug trafficking, and illegal gambling. To protect the integrity of our platform and the broader financial ecosystem, it is crucial that such funds are "cleaned" to appear legitimate, allowing them to pass through financial institutions without raising suspicion.</p>
                            <p>As a responsible company, BillBuddy is committed to complying with all AML laws and regulations in Nigeria, as well as international standards for cryptocurrency transactions, digital asset management, and bill payments. We take all reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that individuals engaged in money laundering, fraud, or other financial crimes do not use our services.</p>
